Data
The analysis performed over ramdomly selected 500 locations. The purpose of the weather analysis is to observe any relationship between 
---Latitude vs. Temperature

---Latitude vs. Humidity

---Latitude vs. Cloudiness

---Latitude vs. Wind Speed

weather analysis conclusion:
---Northern Hemisphere & Sothern Hemisphere Temperature vs. Latitude:There is a strong relationship between Latitude and Max Temperature. For both hemispheres,there is a negative correlation between two variables. When latitude increases ,regardless of number signs,( getting closer to north/south pole) the temperature decreases.

---Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude:There is small relationship between Latitude and Humidity for both hemispheres. The relationship is correlated positively in Northern Hemisphere which means when latitude increases humidity increases as well. 

--Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude:The relationship is less prominent in the Southern hemisphere. Contrary to North, it hardly exist in the south. the humidity level is all over the places in every latitude.

--Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude:There is no linear relationship between Latitude and Cloudiness for both hemispheres. 

--Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude:There is no linear relationship between Latitude and Cloudiness for both hemispheres. 

--Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude:There is no linear relationship between Latitude and Cloudiness for both hemispheres. 

--Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude:There is no linear relationship between Latitude and Cloudiness for both hemispheres. 
 
--This concludes that based on available information, there is a strong relationship between latitide and temperature however, the cloudiness, humidity, and wind speed show no linear relationship to latitude.

Based on the weather analysis, we haev try to create hotel list with the ideal weather conditions. the ideal weather condition is determined based on following criteria
---A max temperature lower than 27 degrees but higher than 21

---Wind speed less than 4.5 m/s

---Zero cloudiness

10 cities between 40 ,-40 latitude has been found and mapped.
